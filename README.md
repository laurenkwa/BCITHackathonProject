# BCITHackathonProject
# RideShare

RideShare is a Slack application that allows users to create routes and request rides on created routes through personal message and the #rideshare channel all managed by our Slack Bot. 

This project also contains a website portion of the application that will allow for users to use applicatino from either the Slack application or online. The integration of the two is under ongoing construction.

This project was created at the BCIT Inaugural Co-op Hackathon and won first prize.
